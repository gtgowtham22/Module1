# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program
Add Code Here
```

a=int(input())
b=int(input())

print(complex(a,b))
```
## Output
![438322586-ecdeb7e5-ae7f-4d8d-ace3-0289b9d21fde](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9f1133-4ead-47ed-a3a8-e0a405e5f148)

## Result
The Python program to read two integers, create a complex number using them, and print the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts was successfully executed.
